# 🐍 Python Learning Repository

Welcome to my **Python Learning Repository**, where I document my journey through Python fundamentals, data structures, algorithms, and advanced programming concepts.

This repository is designed to be cleanly structured, progressive, and useful for others who want to improve their Python skills from the ground up.

## 🧭 Objective

In this project, we will explore the key parts of Python in depth, starting from the fundamentals and progressively covering more advanced algorithmic strategies.

The goal is not only to master Python syntax, but also to understand the logic behind classic programming problems and learn to solve them effectively.

---

## 🚦 Current Status

- Basics: complete
- Functions: complete (basics, args/kwargs, lambdas, recursion, file handling, exceptions);
- Data structures: complete (lists, tuples, dicts and sets). Custom structures (linked lists, stacks, queues) and (Hash tables, Heaps, Tries, ...) pending;
- Algorithms: pending;
- Next up: finish algorithms, then begin OOP

See `progress.md` for the detailed checklist.

## 🚀 Progress & Contributions

This project is a personal learning path and is **continuously evolving**.  
Not all folders or files are complete yet, they will be added progressively as I study and practice each concept.

If you're also learning Python or preparing for coding interviews, feel free to:

- Clone or fork this repository
- Practice with the examples and exercises
- Submit suggestions or improvements
