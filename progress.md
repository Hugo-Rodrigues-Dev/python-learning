# Python Learning Path - Progress Checklist

This file tracks the progress of my journey to master Python, from fundamentals to advanced algorithms and real-world projects.

---

## 🧱 Phase 1 – Python Basics
- [x] Variables and types
- [x] Input/Output
- [x] Conditionals and loops

## 🧱 Phase 2 – Functions & Intermediate Concepts
- [x] Functions (basics, scope, *args, **kwargs)
- [x] Lambdas and recursion
- [ ] Modules and packages
- [ ] Exceptions (try/except/finally)
- [ ] File handling (open, read/write, CSV/JSON)

## 🧱 Phase 3 – Data Structures
- [x] Lists
- [x] Tuples
- [x] Dicts
- [x] Sets
- [ ] Custom structures: Linked lists, Stack, Queue
- [ ] Hash table, Heap, Trie

## 🧱 Phase 4 – Algorithms
- [ ] Sorting (Bubble, Merge, Quick...)
- [ ] Searching (Linear, Binary)
- [ ] Recursion & Backtracking
- [ ] Sliding Window, Two Pointers
